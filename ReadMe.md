# Description

This is my portfolio which describes me and my personal software engineering projects! I built this website using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

# Action items changed from the Demo

The things that I changed based on Josh's advice after my demo are the following:

1. I added a validated form to the Classes page that receives a message and sends it as an email to me. The form is validated using Vue.js and it shows my understanding of Vue and its uses.
2. The second and thing I was told is to make sure I mention that my site has six total pages including my home page. However, my website design incorporates all those six pages into one html document so it gives the user a friendly and smooth experience.
